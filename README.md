# Largentic

A file-based multi-agent harness for using Codex with Laravel projects running locally through Laravel Valet.

The harness uses a structured workflow:

```text
planner -> implementer -> tester -> reviewer
```

Agents transfer work through files such as `harness/plans/plan.md`, `harness/reports/implementation.md`, `harness/reports/test-results.md`, and `harness/reports/review.md`. This keeps the workflow durable and repeatable instead of relying only on chat history.

## Why use this?

This project helps you:

- Split coding work into clear agent responsibilities.
- Keep implementation changes small and reviewable.
- Make Codex hand off work through files.
- Run targeted Laravel/PHPUnit verification.
- Keep browser checks separate through Playwright and Valet.
- Avoid noisy route/report tests when unit tests are more appropriate.
- Build toward reliable retry loops.

## Requirements

- Codex CLI
- PHP and Composer
- Laravel project, commonly Valet-based
- Node.js and npm if using Playwright
- Git

## Installation

Copy `.codex/` and `harness/` into the root of your Laravel project, beside your existing `AGENTS.md`.

Create local config files from examples:

```bash
cd harness
./scripts/bootstrap-local-files.sh
```

Edit:

```text
harness/harness.config.json
harness/state/context.json
harness/playwright.config.js
```

Replace placeholders with your real project path and Valet URL.

## Playwright

Install Playwright in the `harness/` folder:

```bash
cd harness
./scripts/install-playwright.sh
```

## Add this to AGENTS.md file

## Harness Execution Protocol

When the Captain asks to run the harness:

1. Read `harness/prompts/run-harness.md`.
2. Use the planner agent to write `harness/plans/plan.md`.
3. Use the implementer agent to read `harness/plans/plan.md` and implement the patch.
4. Use the tester agent to write `harness/reports/test-results.md`.
5. Use the reviewer agent to write `harness/reports/review.md`.
6. If the tester fails, repeat implementer -> tester.
7. If the review fails, repeat implementer → tester → reviewer.
8. Use files as the source of truth, not chat output.
```

## Replace task in:
```text 
harness/prompts/run-harness.md
```

## Running the Harness

From your Laravel project root:

```bash
codex
```

Simply ask codex to run the harness

```text
run the harness
```

## Workflow

```text
planner -> harness/plans/plan.md
implementer -> harness/reports/implementation.md + harness/artifacts/latest-diff.patch
tester -> harness/reports/test-results.md
reviewer -> harness/reports/review.md
```

If the reviewer rejects the patch:

```text
review.md -> implementer -> tester -> reviewer
```

## Tester Philosophy

The tester agent creates targeted unit tests for changed fields, rules, calculations, services, model methods, validation logic, and edge cases.

By default, it avoids:

- route tests
- report tests
- generic page-load tests
- broad end-to-end tests
- browser-only tests

## Documentation

Read:

- `docs/architecture.md`
- `docs/design-patterns.md`
- `docs/file-handoff.md`
- `docs/codex-setup.md`

## Safety

Do not commit real local state, logs, diffs, secrets, client names, or `.env` files. This repo commits examples only.
